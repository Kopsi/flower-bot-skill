Plant bot communication protocoll

## Description 
The Plant Bot skill transforms a Picroft and a plant into a "sentient" plant with aid of an Arduino, moisture,
light, and temperature sensors. The Plant Bot responds to questions about generall well being and
wether it needs anything. Furthermore it can act on it's own to remind the user, if anything is
critically required for the plant to survive.

## Examples 
* "Do you need anything?"
* "Do you have enough water?"
* "How are you?"
* "Are you edible?"

## Planned Features
TBD
