# BOTani
BOTani communication protocoll

## Description 
The BOTani skill transforms a Picroft and a plant into a "sentient" plant with aid of an Arduino, moisture,
light, and temperature sensors. The plant based bot responds to questions about generall well being and
whether it needs anything. Furthermore it can act on it's own to remind the user, if anything is
critically required for the plant to survive or if being watered or moved into an area with better lighting conditions.

## Examples 
* "Do you need anything?"
* "Do you have enough water?"
* "How are you?"
* "Are you edible?"
